# Bookstore Application

This repository contains a frontend application developed using React, Typescript, TailwindCSS and Redux.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

The Bookstore application is a single-page application that allows users to manage a list of books. The main page displays a list of books with their name, price, category, and a delete button for each book. Users can add new books, modify existing books, and delete books from the main page.

## Features

- Book List: The main page displays a list of books with their details, including name, price, category, and a delete button.
- Add Book: Users can add a new book by clicking the "Add Book" button. This opens a popup page where users can enter the book's name, price, category, and description.
- Modify Book: Clicking on a book in the list opens a popup page that allows users to modify the book's details, including name, price, category, and description. After modification, the book details are updated in the main page.
- Delete Book: Clicking the delete button removes the book from the main page.
